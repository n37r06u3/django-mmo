django-mmo
We're building a MOO in Django, initially based on Game Neverending.

See GNE Museum for details on the original.

Plan
We're trying to track the functionality of GNE initially but can then change things and expand later on.

Status
initial Hub/Lot map model complete
initial Player model complete
initial Item model (pick up / drop and inventory support) complete
item spawning complete
basic making support complete
xp, balance, energy, karma and mood exist but don't change yet
See GNEParity.
