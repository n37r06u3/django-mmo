# django-mmo #

We're building a MOO in Django, initially based on Game Neverending.

See [GNE Museum](http://www.gnespy.com/museum/) for details on the original.

## Plan ##

We're trying to track the functionality of GNE initially but can then change things and expand later on.

## Status ##

  * initial Hub/Lot map model complete
  * initial Player model complete
  * initial Item model (pick up / drop and inventory support) complete
  * item spawning complete
  * basic making support complete
  * xp, balance, energy, karma and mood exist but don't change yet

See [GNEParity](GNEParity.md).
